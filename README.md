# What is this? 

For a long time I have been interested in Ghost Hunting and equally interesting in technology. With modern ghost hunting, a lot of technology can be introduced like EMF Detection, Ghost Orb (Machine Vision), SpiritBox (AM/FM), and more. These provide a lot of points of data, which might be easily overwelming for a human. To combate this, anomoly detection models can be trained to sort through the data and find what to look for. 

To make things more interesting and find locations to "hunt" at, NLP models will be used to generate ghost stories. 

# Goals 

- Implement web scraper to find information about Mt. Pleasant 
- Generate stories based off of that 
- Display stories on a dynamic website with React 
- Eventually start creating ghost hunting tools based on Raspberry Pi platform and feed that data into a pipeline with anomoly detection
